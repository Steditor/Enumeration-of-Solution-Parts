# OpenStreetMap Data

Put `.osm.pbf` files in this directory to provide them for experiments.

A good source for this kind of data is:
> Open Street Map Contributors and Geofabrik GmbH, “OpenStreetMap Data Extracts.” Available from: <https://download.geofabrik.de/>.

The file [download-links.csv](./download-links.csv) contains a list of files that can be downloaded with `cargo run --bin datasets -- osm`.
